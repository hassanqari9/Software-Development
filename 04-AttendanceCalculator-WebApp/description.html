                    <p class="example">Description </p>
                    <p> Normally attendance could be calculated using this formula </p>
              
                    <p class="formula">(Classes Attended / Total Classes Held) * 100</p>
              
                    <p>However, students need this value for two purposes</p>
            
                    <ul>
                    <li>to calculate how many days must they attend to get their attendance upto minimum required percentage</li>
                    <li>to know how many days could be skipped and still not fall below minimum required percentage</li>
                    </ul>
                     
                </div>

                <div class="card2">
                    <p class="example">Example </p>
            
                    <p>If a student has attended 5 classes out of 10, the attendance would be 50% but a student is usualy more
                    interested in knowing how many more days must be attended to get the minimum required value set by the
                    institution. </p>
            
                    <p>Assume 75% is the minimum required attendance then to calculate how many more days a studemt must attend, we made
                    this calculator.</p>
            
                    <p>It would be incorrect to evaluate in this manner</p>
             
                    <p class="formula">
            
                    8 / 10 * 100 = 80% <br>
            
                    8 - 5 = 3 days
             
                    </p>
               
                </div>
                
    
            </div>
    
        </div>
        

    </div>

    <hr style="display: inline-block;">
    <div class="last">
        <p> The correct method would be to increment both classes attended and total classes held until 75% is reached. If
            you do it manually it would look like this: </p>
            <div class="card3">
                <p>
                    (05/10) * 100 = 50.00 <br>
                    (06/11) * 100 = 54.50 <br>
                    (07/12) * 100 = 58.30 <br>
                    (08/13) * 100 = 61.50 <br>
                    (09/14) * 100 = 64.20 <br>
                    (10/15) * 100 = 66.66 <br>
                    (11/16) * 100 = 68.75 <br>
                    (12/17) * 100 = 70.50 <br>
                    (13/18) * 100 = 72.20 <br>
                    (14/19) * 100 = 73.68 <br>
                    (15/20) * 100 = 75.00 <br>
                </p>            
            </div>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">thus a student needs to attend 10 classes in order to get 75%.</p>
